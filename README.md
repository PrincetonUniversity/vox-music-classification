Introduction: Describe dataset, feature types, classification problem
Previous Genre Classification Work: Find some previous work, see why it struggled, see what it says.

# Long-term Tasks

1. Analyze richness and necessity of features: PCA look at eigenvalues. Look at sparsity.
2. Try other classifiers: mSVM, Decision Tree (boosted?), LDA, ensemble
3. Heierichal group-based decisions (0/1 split into easier categories - how to choose genre subsets?)
4. Mess with Fisher Vector parameters
5. Encode temporal data (Exemplar?)

Write up exploration, method, results, and conclusion section for above.
